        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Antipasto is an Italian appetizer 
            course offering a snacky selection 
            of cured meats, pickled vegetables, 
            cheeses, olives, anchovies and more. 
            The word “antipasto” means “before 
            the meal” so it’s basically an 
            appetizer platter. This gorgeous 
            spread is usually served as part of 
            a formal meal, rather than an 
            everyday spread. You can read more 
            about antipasto here.</p>
        <p>So to make an antipasto salad I simply 
            piled all those tasty little bits on 
            top of a bed of greens and added a 
            cheesy Italian dressing. And that’s 
            all I really want in a summer meal. 
            Okay, well, maybe some crusty bread 
            to go along with it. ;)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz. salad greens of choice</li>
            <li>1 12oz. jar artichoke hearts</li>
            <li>1 pint grape tomatoes</li>
            <li>8 oz. mozzarella </li>
            <li>1 6oz. jar kalamata olives</li>
            <li>1 8oz. jar banana peppers</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion</li>
            <li>8 oz. provolone</li>
            <li>Italian dressing of choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut or slice any cheeses into 
                bite-sized pieces. Drain the 
                olives and any brined vegetables. 
                Thinly slice the red onion and 
                slice the grape tomatoes in half.</li>
            <li>Lay your greens in the bottom of 
                a bowl, then top with your 
                antipasto items. Drizzle dressing 
                over the salad (start with half 
                the dressing and add more as 
                needed). Toss the salad until 
                everything is coated in dressing, 
                then enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
