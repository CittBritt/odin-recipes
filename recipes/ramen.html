    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I hope I’ve convinced you to experiment 
        with leftovers in your fridge by now. 
        Most of my favorite recipe creations have 
        come from me just piling whatever I have 
        leftover in my fridge into a bowl or pot, 
        and seeing how it turns out, including 
        this Vegan Creamy Mushroom Ramen. I’m not 
        kidding when I say this is one of the best 
        things I’ve ever tasted, and it only takes 
        about 15 minutes and a handful of 
        ingredients. #totalwin

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>4 oz. baby bella mushrooms</li>
            <li>1.5 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 handful fresh spinach</li>
            <li>1 package ramen noodles (discard seasoning)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut milk (canned)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the mushrooms. Add them to a small
            sauce pot with the cooking oil and sauté
            over medium heat until the mushrooms are
            soft, dark, and all the moisture in the 
            bottom of the pot has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable broth, turn the heat up 
            to medium-high, and bring the broth up to 
            a boil. Once boiling, add the ramen noodles
            (without the seasoning packet) to the broth. 
            Cook the noodles in the boiling broth for 
            about 3 minutes, or until tender.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off, add a heaping handful of 
            fresh spinach, and stir until the spinach is 
            wilted (about 30 seconds). Pour the coconut 
            milk into the pot and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve the Vegan Creamy Coconut Ramen as-is, 
            or with garnishes like green onion or chili 
            garlic sauce.</li>
    
    </ol>
