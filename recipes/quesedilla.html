        <p>Students and other busy people take 
           note: this recipe is perfect for you!</p>
        <p>I  called them “hearty” black bean 
           quesadillas because they are 
           surprisingly filling. I hastily ate 
           two and then promptly felt like my 
           belly was not just full, but full-
           full. This is one of those vegetarian 
           recipes that meat-eaters won’t feel 
           deprived when eating. Promise.</p>
        <p>These Hearty Black Bean Quesadillas 
           are an easy vegetarian snack or light 
           meal that are filling, flavorful, and 
           freezer-friendly!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 15oz.can black beans</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 bunch fresh cilantro (about ½ cup chopped)</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 batch taco seasoning</li>
            <li>10 flour tortillas (7-inch diameter)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the black beans and add 
                them to a bowl along with the 
                frozen corn (no need to thaw).</li>
            <li>Finely dice the onion, mince the
                garlic, and roughly chop the 
                cilantro.</li>
            <li>Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, 
                shredded cheddar, and taco 
                seasoning to the bowl with the 
                beans and corn. Stir until 
                everything is evenly combined and 
                coated in seasoning.</li>
            <li>Place a half cup of the filling 
                on one side of each tortilla and 
                fold over. Cook the quesadillas 
                in a skillet over medium heat on 
                each side until brown and crispy 
                and the cheesy filling has melted. 
                Slice into triangles then serve.</li>
            <li>To freeze the quesadillas, stack 
                the filled and uncooked 
                quesadillas with a piece of 
                parchment paper between each 
                quesadilla. Place in a freezer 
                bag and freeze for up to three 
                months. To reheat either 
                microwave (for a soft quesadilla) 
                or cook in a skillet on low heat 
                (make sure to use low heat so 
                that the filling has time to thaw 
                and melt before the outside 
                burns).</li>
        </ol>
